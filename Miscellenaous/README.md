# GET and POST Request type
Upto this point we have learnt about node js and it's framework and also about templating , through which we can create a template(view) and ejs file for a page which is using continously for every user.
It is like a layout, like the blueprint of a form , the form is created once and each candidate can fill it's information in this blueprint, in the same way templating works, 

Suppose you are on a instagram page and you are on your profile where you can see all the posts, followers count, followings count, and can edit your bio ,means the instagram company has to make layout for every user, the answer is big NOAH !!! the company makes a single page, layout using templating and based on user's data the page is shown/render to the user as a response..

So yeah, this is all about templating , sending / rendering dynamic web pages to the client as a response and also including static (css + js) files.

Let's get deeper into the Type of Requests.....
