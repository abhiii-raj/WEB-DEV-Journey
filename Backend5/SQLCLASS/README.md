   2-> using mysql package.
        > run node index.js

   3-> using CLI.

   4-> using sql files. 
        > Create the structure in a seperate file.
        > go into the environment of mysql.
            "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysql.exe" -u root -p
        > in your terminal mysql> appears this will indicate that you are in the realm of sql ðŸ˜….
        > then run command -> source fileName.sql;
            and make sure to run from that directory where your file resides...
        > when you are in the mysql env clear command won't run
          use system cls; command and
          exit; to exit from the sql env;
