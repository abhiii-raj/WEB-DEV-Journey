Till now we have covered only the relational database in which we store our data into rows and columns(Tables).
From now on we will look forward to another aspect of storing our data.
It is like the wardrobe in NARNIA,
open the door of the wardrobe and you are in a new realm.

Now we will look after the MongoDB, it is an example of non-relational database where storing the data in the table doesn't
matters...

# MONGO-DB
